        <h1>MY BIOGRAPHY</h1>

			<p>
				My name is Aira Dimaano Buemia, and I am 21 years old. I live in Rawis, Bacon District, Sorsogon City, 
				and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminology at the Sorsogon College of Criminology Incorporated. 
				I have a younger sister who is also in college. My parents are separated.<br><br>
		
				I was born at the Sorsogon Provincial Hospital, and my sister and I were raised by our grandmother until our mother decided it was time for us to live with her. 
				At first, we thought it would be better for us to live with our parents, away from our grandmother's care. 
				We didn't fully understand, however, that the house they built for us was meant for us to live independently. 
				Although it was hard for my parents to leave us, they did it because they believed it would be better for our future. 
				They needed to provide for us in a way that went beyond just giving us a roof over our heads. 
				We never held a grudge because we understood that everything they did was for our sake, even if it meant making tough decisions.<br><br>
		
				My mom always said that nothing would change for us unless she helped my father with work. 
				My father’s salary wasn’t enough to meet all our needs, and sometimes we struggled. 
				That’s why my mom had no choice but to leave us in the house that had been built for us. 
				Looking back, I see it as a blessing because it taught me things I never knew I was capable of. 
				I learned how to problem-solve, budget, and make decisions with the resources I had. As the older sister, 
				I had to take on responsibilities that I wasn’t ready for, but deep down I knew it had a purpose, 
				and everything would be okay if I kept my focus on what mattered.<br><br>
		
				I did my best to make my parents proud and never let them down. 
				Their sacrifices are what motivate me to keep going, and I want to repay them for everything they've done for us. 
				That’s why I believe it’s important to never harbor anger or resentment toward our parents, especially when they are far away. 
				Their actions are always rooted in love, and everything they do is for our future. It’s not for their own benefit; it’s always for us. 
				So, love your parents, respect their choices, and make them proud, because they only want the best for you.<br><br>
		
				"The greatest gift you can give your parents is to live a life that makes them proud. 
				No matter the struggles, remember that their love and sacrifices are always for your better tomorrow."<br><br>
		
				This quote resonates deeply with me because it reflects my gratitude for everything my parents have done. 
				I want to be the person they always believed I could be, and I know that living a life of integrity and hard work is the best way to honor their sacrifices. 
				Through all the struggles, their love remains the guiding force in my life.
