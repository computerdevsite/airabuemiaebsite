                <p>Chances are you’ve heard how important it is to keep viruses out, but what is 
                    a computer virus exactly?
                    A computer virus is a type of malicious software, 
                    or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software.
                    Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, 
                    and result in data loss and leakage.
                    A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems.
                    Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results 
                    in their viral codes executing when a file is opened.
                    The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, 
                    drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.
                    Chances are you’ve heard how important it is to keep viruses out, but what 
                    is a computer virus exactly?
                    A computer virus will more than likely have 
                    an adverse effect on the device it resides on and may be discoverable 
                    through common signs of performance loss, including:.</p>

                 <h2>
                    1. Speed of system
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    A computer system running slower than usual is one of the most common signs that the device has a virus. 
                    This includes the system itself running slowly, as well as applications and internet speed suffering. 
                    If a computer does not have powerful applications or programs installed and is running slowly, then 
                    it may be a sign it is infected with a virus.
                </p>    

                <h2>
                    2. Pop-up windows
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    Unwanted pop-up windows appearing on a computer or in a web browser are a telltale sign of a computer virus.
                    Unwanted pop-ups are a sign of malware, viruses, or spyware affecting a device.
                </p> 

                <h2>
                    3. Programs self-executing
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    If computer programs unexpectedly close by themselves, then it is highly likely that the software 
                    has been infected with some form of virus or malware. Another indicator of a virus is when applications 
                    fail to load when selected from the Start menu or their desktop icon. Every time that happens, 
                    your next step should be to perform a virus scan and remove any files on programs that might not be safe to use.
                </p> 

                <h2>
                    4. Accounts being logged out
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    Some viruses are designed to affect specific applications, which will either cause them to crash or force the user 
                    to automatically log out of the service.
                </p> 

                <h2>
                    5. Crashing of the device
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    System crashes and the computer itself unexpectedly closing down are common indicators of a virus.
                    Computer viruses cause computers to act in a variety of strange ways, which may include opening files by themselves,
                    displaying unusual error messages, or clicking keys at random.
                </p> 

                <h2>
                    6. Mass emails being sent from your email account
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    Computer viruses are commonly spread via email. Hackers can use other people's email accounts to spread malware and
                    carry out wider cyberattacks. Therefore, if an email account has sent emails in the outbox that a user did not send,
                    then this could be a sign of a computer virus.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    7. Changes to your homepage
                 </h2>   

                <p>
                    Any unexpected changes to a computer—such as your system’s homepage being amended or any browser settings 
                    being updated—are signs that a computer virus may be present on the device.
